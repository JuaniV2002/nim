## About
This project ports the logic of a Haskell Nim AI (using the Minimax algorithm) to modern JavaScript, allowing it to be played directly in the browser.

## Features
- 🤖 **Unbeatable AI**: Uses a Minimax algorithm to play optimally.
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, dark-themed interface with responsive design.
- ⚡ **Lightweight**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no heavy frameworks.

## How to Play
1. Select the initial number of stones.
2. Take turns removing 1, 3, or 4 stones.
3. The player who takes the last stone wins!

## Development
- **Logic**: The game logic (`game.js`) is a direct port of the original Haskell implementation (`TP.hs`).
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with a dark color scheme (`style.css`).
